# Xournal++ Toolbar Icon for online WordWrapper
As Xournal++ does not have a built-in word wrapping tool, this plugin adds a toolbar icon   for opening an online word wrapping tool in the default browser.

### Installation:
- Download the `WordWrap` folder from this repository.
- Copy the `WordWrap` folder to your Xournal++ plugins directory. (Usually located at
`.../Program Files\Xournal++\share\xournalpp\plugins\`)
- From the 'WordWrap' folder, cut the 'word_wrap.svg' file, and paste it to the 'icons' folder in the Xournal++ directory, this can vary by theme, but by default, is located at `...\Program Files\Xournal++\share\icons\Adwaita\symbolic\ui`, if your theme is different than the default Adwaita theme, your path is usually `...\Program Files\Xournal++\share\icons\YourThemeName\symbolic\ui`.
- Open Xournal++, go to `View -> Toolbars -> Customize Toolbars`, and add the 'WordWrap' icon to your toolbar.
